\begin{example}[质点运动学的计算---\refleaftext{solution2.1}]
    计算练习：已知$a(t)=at^{\alpha }$，$\alpha$是正的常数，初始时间、速度和位置$t_{i}$，$v_{i}$，$x_{i}$都是已知的，求出$v(t)$，$x(t)$这两个表达式。
\end{example}
\begin{example}[质点运动学的计算---\refleaftext{solution2.2}]
    Automotive engineers refer to the time rate of change
    of acceleration as the `\itr{jerk}{加加速度}'. If an object moves in one dimension such that its jerk $J$ is constant,\\
    (a) determine expressions for its acceleration $a_{t}$, velocity $v_{t}$, and position $x_{t}$, given that its initial acceleration, speed, and position are $a_{0}$, $ v_{0} $ , and $x_{0}$, respectively.\\
    (b) Show that $ a_{t}{}^ {2} = a_{0}{}^ {2}  +2J(  v_ {t}  -  v_ {0}  )$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}[质点动力学的计算---\refleaftext{solution2.3}]
    Assume that the \itr{resistive force}{阻力} acting on a speed skater
    is $f=- kmv^ {2} $ , where $k$ is a constant and m is the skater's
    mass. The skater crosses the finish line of a straight-line
    race with speed $ v_ {f } $ and then slows down by coasting on
    his skates. Show that the skater's speed at any time t
    after crossing the finish line is $v_{t} = v_ {f}  / (1+  ktv_ {f}  )$.

\end{example}

\begin{example}[质点动力学相关计算---\refleaftext{solution2.4}]
    A \itr{semisphere}{半球} of mass $M$ and radius $R$ is put on a \itr{frictionless}{无摩擦的} horizontal table and can move freely.
    A block of mass m is located on the top of this semisphere.
    Initially both the semisphere and the block are at rest.
    Then the block is \itr{perturbed}{扰动} such that it starts to slide down the semisphere from rest.
    The block \itr{detaches}{脱离} the semisphere at angle $\theta$.
    Neglect the size of the block and the friction between the block and the semisphere.

    (a) Find the angle $\theta$ (It is enough to give the equation in which $\theta$ is the only unknown quantity. You do not need to solve this equation if it is too complicated for you).\\
    (b) What is the value of $\theta$ when $m \ll M$ and $m \gg M$?
\end{example}

\begin{example}[质点动力学相关计算---\refleaftext{solution2.5}]
    A small mass m is pulled to the top of a \itr{frictionless}{无摩擦的} \itr{half-cylinder}{半圆柱} (of radius $R$) by a \itr{cord}{线} that passes over the top of the cylinder.\\
    (a) If the mass moves at a constant speed, show that $F=mg\cos\theta$ (Hint:If the mass moves at a constant speed, the component of its acceleration tangent to the cylinder must be zero at all times.).\\
    (b) By directly integrating $\displaystyle W=\int \vec{F}\cdot \dif \vec{s}$, find the work done in moving the mass at constant speed from the bottom to the top of the half-cylinder. Here $\dif \vec{s}$ represents an \itr{incremental}{增加的} displacement of the small mass.
